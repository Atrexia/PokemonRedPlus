## About Pokémon Red+

This fork aims to create **Pokémon Red+**, a version-enhanced ROM hack which allows the player to switch between **Red** and **Blue** version content from a single game.

### Planned Features

- Title screen option to choose **Red** or **Blue** version mode
- Access to version-exclusive Pokémon without separate ROMs
- All core gameplay remains faithful to Gen 1

> *This is an ongoing WIP and not currently intended for public distribution.*
